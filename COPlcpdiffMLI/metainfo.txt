Published in: Time-varying Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas Using Adaptively Simulated Critical Values

Description: 'Calculates and plots the no. of different test steps per time point for the two approaches of LCP. The results from LCP correspond to the approach with pre-simulated critical values and the approach with adaptively simulated critical values. In addition, the dynamics of the difference in the ML criterion are plotted as well. The estimated model is a
three-dimensional HAC with Gumbel generators.'

Keywords: copula, gumbel, HAC, maximum-likelihood, nested Archimedean copula, plot

Output:  

Example: 
- 1: Difference in test steps (positive values indicate that the pre-simulation approach used more test steps than the adaptive simulation approach and vice versa for negative values)
- 2: Difference in ML (positive values indicate that the pre-simulation approach shows a better goodness-of-fit than the adaptive simulation approach, the opposite holds for negative values)
