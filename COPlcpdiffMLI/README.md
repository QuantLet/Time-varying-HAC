Name of Quantlet: COPlcpdiffMLI

Published in: Time-varying Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas Using Adaptively Simulated Critical Values

Description: Calculates and plots the no. of different test steps per time point for the two approaches of LCP. The results from LCP correspond to the approach with presimulated critical values and the approach with adaptively simulated critical values. In addition, the dynamics of the difference in the ML criterion are plotted as well. The estimated model is a three-dimensional HAC with Gumbel generators.

Keywords: copula, gumbel, HAC, maximum-likelihood, nested Archimedean copula, plot

Output: 

Example: 
- 1: Difference in test steps (positive values indicate that the pre-simulation approach used more test steps than the adaptive simulation approach and vice versa for negative values)
- 2: Difference in ML (positive values indicate that the pre-simulation approach shows a better goodness-of-fit than the adaptive simulation approach, the opposite holds for negative values)
