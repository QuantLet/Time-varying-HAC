Name of Quantlet: COPRollingBIC

Published in: Time-varying Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas Using Adaptively Simulated Critical Values

Description: 'Plots the BIC calculated in a rolling window with r = 250 for hierarchical Archimedean copula (HAC), Archimedean copula (AC) and Gauss copula. The HAC and AC are based on Gumbel generators. In addition, the plot includes the dynamics of the parameters of HAC. It includes dots where the structure of HAC changes and the L2 norm of the difference in the matrix of dependence parameters. The data underlying the BIC are residuals from fitting GARCH(1,1) to log returns of DAX, Dow Jones and Nikkei.'
